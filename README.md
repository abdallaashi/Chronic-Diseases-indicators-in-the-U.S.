# Chronic-Diseases-indicators-in-the-U.S.

## Description

Chronic Diseases in the U.S.: Overview, Gender Gap, and State Comparison, the goal of this analysis explores key indicators of chronic diseases across the United States, focusing on prevalence, gender disparities, and geographic variation. By examining data trends, we highlight how chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity differ between men and women and across states. The insights aim to inform public health strategies and identify areas for targeted intervention.

## Dataset

The data set was from CDC website:

https://data.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators/hksd-2xuw/about_data

CDC's Division of Population Health provides a cross-cutting set of 115 indicators developed by consensus among CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors. These indicators allow states and territories to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice in their area. In addition to providing access to state-specific indicator data, the CDI web site serves as a gateway to additional information and data resources.

## Analysis

we analyzed the data to find mortality rate in US focusing on answering the following 3 topics:

- Chronic Disease Mortality â€“ Underlying Cause (U.S.)
- Gender Gap in Chronic Disease Mortality (U.S.)
- State Comparison in Chronic Disease Mortality (U.S.)

## How to run

To run our code first run the cleaning notebook where the output is the cleaned data set saved as CSV file.

The next step is to run the code on the cleaned data set where each topic above has a separate notebook/code to reach the conclusion and have the visualization charts used in the presentation

## Dependencies

the following Python libraries were used:

- pandas
- mataplotlib
- seaborn
